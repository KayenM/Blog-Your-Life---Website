# Travel-With-Me

Every trip big or small is an adventure worth sharing! Use thi site to share your travels with the world, write articles, upload photos, and so much more!

The front end of this Blog website was built using HTML and CSS, and enhanced by leveraging Bootstrap! The back-end of this website was created using Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates). The database of this application is powered by a local MondgoDB database system. 

This project served as my introduction to CRUD operations and using non-relational databases. I also learned about how EJS templates and NPM modules can be leveraged! I had so much fun making this and I hope you like the code!
