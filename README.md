# Blog-Your-Life-Application

Are you tired of forgetting what you ate for lunch yesterday or what you did last weekend? Keep track of your days and share it to the world using this blog website!

The front end of this Blog website was built using HTML and CSS, and enhanced by leveraging Bootstrap! The back-end of this website was created using Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates). The database of this application is powered by a local MondgoDB database system. 

This project served as my introduction to CRUD operations and using non-relational databases. I also learned about how EJS templates and NPM modules can be leveraged! I had so much fun making this and I hope you like the code!
